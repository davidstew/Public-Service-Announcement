# cmps183-ucsc-psa
Our project for cmps183

We used web2py, vue js, and the leaflet api.

Goals:
We built this site so that it would be easier for users to be informed of things going on around campus, and give them a visual representation what is happening around them. We wanted to make a more interconnected community on campus. We wanted users to be able to create announcements and events, and mark where things are on the map. Finally, we wanted to let other users inform others if things were broken or not around campus.

Link to the site currently hosted on python anywhere:

Some known bugs:
entering a invalid date in the date form for a event breaks the site.
Announcement info doesn't update on the left when you delete a announcement but the 2 lists do.
